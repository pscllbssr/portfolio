## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

This is my first blog post. Here you have an average picture of a mountain:

Thanks to [Ryan Fitzgerald](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devfolio) for making the gatsby-template you are looking at.

Here is a little Javascript code-block to wrap things up.

```js
const helloWorld = (name = 'World') => {
  return `Hello ${name}!`;
};

helloWorld();
```

The end.
